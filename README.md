# PRODIGY_GA_04
## Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN
### Description
A Python-based project utilizing Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to perform advanced image-to-image translation tasks. This project is designed to enable transformations such as style transfer, domain adaptation, and object generation with precise control over the output by conditioning the model with auxiliary information.

### Features
- **Versatile Image-to-Image Translation**
Enables tasks like converting sketches to images, night-to-day transitions, and semantic label-to-photo synthesis.
- **Conditioning for Enhanced Control**
Utilizes conditional inputs (labels or images) to guide the GAN’s output, ensuring targeted and accurate image generation.
- **Scalable and Robust Architecture**
Leverages cGAN’s ability to generalize across various domains, making it suitable for diverse applications, including industrial use cases.
- **Visualization and Tuning Tools**
Includes utilities for inspecting and fine-tuning generator and discriminator outputs for improved performance.
### Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch (for building and training the cGAN)
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing and transformations)
- Matplotlib (for result visualization)

## Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**
